We'll describe the situation and then our response to it. First, the situation:

h2. The situation

Many people feel a need for better conversations, to collaborate to figure out what's true, what's important, what's useful, 
and how we feel about it.

There are online deliberation systems [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_deliberation]] , but they are isolated from one 
another. One interacts with strangers, often with no good way to evaluate their credibility, if they are just a username. 
They may have been highly rated, but by whom? Likely not by anyone one knows, and there is no visiblity into this.

There are social networks, some of which (like Facebook) attempt to boost quality by ensuring that participants use their real 
names. But they don't do much. They just allow people to post content and for others to "like" or comment on it.

A new social network, especially a Facebook-alternative like [[https://diasporafoundation.org/]], finds a hard time getting 
traction due to network effects: It isn't very useful until a lot of other people are using it. This is a "chicken and egg" problem.

Nonviolent communication is a method for structuring conversations, which gets people to reflect on whether they are expression 
observations, feelings, needs, and requests.

Mind mapping is a tool for showing how thoughts relate to one another. A mind map is structured like a tree, which is a type of 
graph, like the graph in a social network.

h2. Our response

We propose to create a deliberative system based on nonviolent communication (with enhancements) and sharing of content linked to
content posted by friends and friends-of-friends. Not only that, but each user can rate the content of his or her friends on a 
numeric scale, in terms of merit or specific qualities.  One can define formulas that will selectively filter in or our the 
content or ratings of one's friends.
