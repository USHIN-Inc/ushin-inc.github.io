Liam - not sure if you wanted me to chop away at this, I really like the format, which
summarized for brevity, expounded for inclusion of key points, and removed what seemed to me inconsistent use of the term "need", and any statement of fact without citations.

h1. The situation

The internet lacks means for people, using their own channels of information, to peek outside the confines of their information bubbles to connect around issues meaningfully on neutral ground. People have little control of the information that shows on their screens, where it comes from, nor do we have mechanisms to assess content validity and reap potential utility.

The prototype booklet, U4U, page 2, lists current systems of communication and information, online and offline, and describes how each type falls short of meeting human needs for meaningful interaction, and in combination hamper free access to knowledge relevant to our lives.

Some confusing issues, such as concerns for both privacy and security, have no opportunity for public, inclusive deliberation. Facts and feelings, thoughts and needs, people and actions, merits and other topics, are in a frustrated knot.

New distributed social networks, including Diaspora,[[https://diasporafoundation.org/]] offer relatively few services, include relatively few people, and do not integrate with existing channels.

h1. Our response

USHIN has a great hook, with multiple projects that integrate with each other and existing methods of communication and information.

USHIN will meet a list of needs [[ link to the long list of needs in the NUTSHELL page]] beyond that of connecting friends and passing along random bits of information from anywhere. USHIN is a way to bring people together no matter where they are, offline and online. USHIN puts users in control of our screens with filters we choose and levels of support we can take or leave according to our own preferences. USHIN has a novel and intriguing business plan that is inspiring, creative, original, heartwarming, newsworthy and welcoming.

USHIN is bringing compassionate communication methods to the internet, with tools for everyone, wherever they see the USHIN logo. Click this logo to show its eight shapes larger, and open access to a new, shared, vetted, digital commons we all co-create and enjoy.

To solve the conundrum of simultaneous privacy and authentication in such a digital commons, USHIN combines mediating curators, transparent networks, verification protocols and blockchain data/contract security.

USHIN unravels the strands of any complex consideration, so that users view multiple perspectives as they choose.

USHIN combines existing technology, such as client side databases, distributed systems, P2P protocols, git technology for collaborative knowledge bases, disruptive graphical user interface so fun users semantically parse, rank, filter and relay text to curators who merge contributions into a growing network of similarly tagged knowledge bases.

USHIN will appear likely to take off with little risk in staking a claim to one's own sector of the new digital space.

The deliberative prototype being designed, U4U, will model collaborative sharing of content by representing certain tags in certain physical regions of computer and device screens. This will make it simple for users to create and use tags for finding and using prototype information. Some ushin products and services are being conducted within the U4U protoype sandbox and others rely on independent communities who will control their own tags and protocols. Supporters are building relationships with a handful of communities to test a variety of ushin tools as to how they meet each communities' individual and collective current needs.
